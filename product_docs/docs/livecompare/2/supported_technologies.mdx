LiveCompare can connect to and compare data from a list of technologies,
including PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD, formerly known as BDR), and Oracle.

LiveCompare has three kinds of connections:

-   **Initial** (optional): Used to fetch metadata about pglogical or PGD
    connections. Required if data connections are pglogical or PGD, and if
    `replication_sets` or `node_name` settings are used. Requires
    `logical_replication_mode = pglogical` or `logical_replication_mode = bdr`. 
    A pglogical- or PGD-enabled database is required.
-   **Data**: The actual database connection that the tool connects to to perform
    data comparison. The first connection in the list is used to solve `Table
    Filter` and `Row Filter`, and is also used with the `Initial
    Connection' to gather information about PGD nodes. If
    `logical_replication_mode = bdr` and `all_bdr_nodes = on`, then LiveCompare
    considers all PGD nodes that are part of the same PGD cluster as the `Initial
    Connection`. In this case, you don't need to define data connections
    individually. The fix can be potentially applied in all data connections, as comparison
    and consensus decisions work per row.
-   **Output** (mandatory): Where LiveCompare creates a schema called
    `livecompare`, some tables, and views. This is required to keep progress and
    reporting data about comparison sessions. It must be a PostgreSQL or
    2ndQPostgres connection.

The table shows versions and details about supported technologies and the context in which you can use them in LiveCompare.

| Technology                     | Versions                        | Possible connections                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| PostgreSQL                     | 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 | Data and output          |
| EDB PostgreSQL Extended        | 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15      | Data and output          |
| EDB PostgreSQL Advanced (EPAS) | 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15               | Data and output          |
| pglogical                      | 2 and 3                         | Initial, data, and output |
| EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) | 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5                   | Initial, data, and output |
| Oracle                         | 11g, 12c, 18c, 19c, and 21c      | A single data connection    |

## PgBouncer support

You can use LiveCompare against nodes through PgBouncer. However, you must use
`pool_mode=session` because LiveCompare uses prepared statements on PostgreSQL,
which isn't possible when `pool_mode` is either `transaction` or
`statement`.
