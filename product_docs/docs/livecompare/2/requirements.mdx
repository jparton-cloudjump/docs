LiveCompare requires:

-   Python 3.6 or 3.7
-   PostgreSQL / EDB Postgres Extended 9.5+ / EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11+ (on the output connection)
-   PostgreSQL / EDB Postgres Extended 9.4+ / EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11+ or Oracle 11g+ (on the data connections being compared)

LiveCompare requires Debian 10+, Ubuntu 16.04+, SLES 12 SP5 and 15 SP3, or CentOS/RHEL/RockyLinux/AlmaLinux 7+.

You can install LiveCompare from the EnterpriseDB `products/livecompare` repository. For details, see the [EDB customer portal](https://techsupport.enterprisedb.com/customer_portal/sw/livecompare/).

LiveCompare installs on top of either:

-   The latest Python version for Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS/RHEL 8, as provided by the `python3` packages
-   Python 3.6 for CentOS/RHEL 7, as provided by the `python-36` packages

On CentOS/RHEL distributions, LiveCompare also requires the EPEL repository. For details, see the [EPEL webpage](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL).

Specifically on CentOS/RHEL version 7, the Python component `tqdm` is too old (&lt; 4.16.0). You can install the latest `tqdm` using `pip` or `pip3` for the user that is running LiveCompare:

```
pip install --user tqdm --upgrade
```

If running LiveCompare against an Oracle database, Oracle Instant Client must be installed. See [Oracle support requirements](oracle_support/#requirements) for more information.

## LiveCompare with TPAexec

You can use the following sample config for `TPAexec` to build a server with `LiveCompare` and `PostgreSQL 11`:
