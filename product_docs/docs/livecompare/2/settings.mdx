## General settings

-   `logical_replication_mode`: Affects how the program interprets connections and table filter settings and also the requirements to check for in the connections before starting the comparison. Currently the possible values are:

    - `off`: Assumes there's no logical replication between the databases.

    - `native`: Assumes there's native logical replication between the databases. Enables the use of the `Table Filter -> publications` setting to specify the list of tables to use. Requires PostgreSQL 10+ on all databases.

    - `pglogical`: Assumes there's pglogical replication between the databases. Enables the use of the `Table Filter -> replication_sets` setting to specify the list of tables to use. Also enables the use of `node_name` to specify the data connections, which requires setting the `Initial Connection` that's used to retrieve DSN information of the nodes. Requires the `pglogical` extensions to be installed on all databases.

    - `bdr`: Assumes all data connections are nodes from the same PGD cluster.
    Enables use of the `Table Filter -> replication_sets` setting to specify the list
    of tables to use. Also enables the use of `node_name` to
    specify the data connections, which requires setting the `Initial Connection`
    that's used to retrieve DSN information of the nodes. Requires `pglogical`
    and `bdr` extensions installed on all databases.

-   `all_bdr_nodes`: If `logical_replication_mode` is set to `bdr`, then you can specify only the Initial Connection and let LiveCompare
    build the connection list based on the current list of active PGD nodes.
    Default: `off`.

-   `max_parallel_workers`: Number of parallel processes to consider. Each
    process works on a table from the queue. Default: `2`.

    !!! Important
        Each process keeps N+1 open connections: one to each data connection and another one to the output database.

-   `buffer_size`: Number of rows to retrieve from the tables on every data
    fetch operation. Default: `4096`.

-   `log_level`: Verbosity level in the log file. Possible values: `debug`,
    `info`, `warning`, or `error`. Default: `info`.

-   `data_fetch_mode`: Affects how LiveCompare fetches data from the database.

    -   `prepared_statements`: Uses prepared statements (a query with `LIMIT`) for
        data fetch. Only a very small amount of data (`buffer_size = 4096` rows by
        default) is fetched each time, so it has the smallest impact of all three modes,
        and for the same reason it's the safer fetch mode. Allows asynchronous data
        fetch (defined by `parallel_data_fetch`). For the general use case, this
        fetch method provides good performance, but a performance decrease can be
        felt for large tables. This is the default and strongly recommended when
        server load is medium-high.

    -   `server_side_cursors_with_hold`: Uses server-side cursors `WITH HOLD` for
        data fetch. As table data is retrieved in a single transaction, it holds
        back `xmin` and can cause bloat and replication issues and also prevent
        `VACUUM` from running well. Also, the `WITH HOLD` clause tells Postgres to
        materialize the query (workers can hang for a few seconds waiting for the
        data to materialize), so the whole table data consumes RAM and can be
        stored on Postgres side disk as temporary files. You can reduce all that impact 
        by using `parallel_chunk_rows` (disabled by default), and improve
        speed by increasing `buffer_size` a little. Allows
        asynchronous data fetch (defined by `parallel_data_fetch`). For the general
        use case, this fetch method doesn't provide any benefits when compared to
        `prepared_stataments`, but for multiple small tables it's faster. However,
        this mode is recommended only when load is very low, for example, on tests
        and migration scenarios.

    -   `server_side_cursors_without_hold`: Uses server-side cursors
        `WITHOUT HOLD` for data fetch. As `server_side_cursors_with_hold`, this
        mode can also hold back `xmin`, thus it potentially can cause bloat, `VACUUM`,
        and replication issues on Postgres. However, such impact is higher because
        `WITHOUT HOLD` cursors require an open transaction for the whole comparison
        session (this requirement will be lifted in later versions). As the snapshot is held
        for the whole comparison session, comparison results might be helpful
        depending on your use case. As the query isn't materialized, memory usage
        and temp file generation remains low. Asynchronous data fetch isn't
        allowed. In terms of performance, this mode is slower for the general use
        case, but for large tables it can be the faster. We recommend it when load
        on the database is low-medium.

!!! Important
    The choice of the right `data_fetch_mode` for the right scenario
    is very important. Using prepared statements has the smallest footprint on the
    database server, so it's the safest approach, and it's good for the general use
    case. Another point is that prepared statements allow LiveCompare to always see
    the latest version of the rows, which might not happen when using server-side
    cursors on a busy database. So we recommend using `prepared_statements` for
    production, high-load servers and either `server_side_cursors_*` setting for
    testing, migration scenarios, and low-load servers. The best strategy 
    probably mixes `server_side_cursors_without_hold` for very large tables and
    `prepared_statements` for the remaining tables. The following table shows
    a comparison of the cost/benefit ratio.

|                    | prepared_statements | server_side_cursors_with_hold | server_side_cursors_without_hold |
| ------------------ | :-----------------: | :---------------------------: | :------------------------------: |
| xmin hold          |       very low      |             medium            |               high               |
| xmin released per  |        buffer       |             chunk             |     whole comparison session     |
| temp files         |       very low      |           very high           |                low               |
| memory             |       very low      |              high             |                low               |
| allows async conns |         yes         |              yes              |                no                |
| fastest for        |       general       |          small tables         |           large tables           |
| recommended load   |         high        |            very low           |            low-medium            |

!!! Note "Note about Oracle"
    For Oracle, the `data_fetch_mode` setting is completely
    ignored, and data is always fetched from Oracle using a direct query. 
    Data is taken in chunks of `buffer_size` through the client-side cursor.

-   `parallel_chunk_rows`: Minimum number of rows required to consider splitting a
    table into multiple chunks for parallel comparison. A hash is used to fetch
    data, so workers don't clash with each other. Each table chunk has no more
    than `parallel_chunk_rows` rows. Setting it to any value &lt;1 disables table
    splitting. Default: `0` (disabled).

!!! Important
    While table splitting can help multiple workers to compare a large table in
    parallel, performance for each worker can be affected by
    the hash condition being applied to all rows. Depending on the Postgres
    configuration (especially with the default of `random_page_cost = 4`, which can
    be considered too conservative for modern hard drives), the Postgres query
    planner can incorrectly prefer bitmap heap scans. If the database is
    running on SSD, disabling bitmap heap scan on LiveCompare can significantly
    improve the comparison performance. You can do this per connection using the
    `start_query` setting:

    ```ini
    start_query = set enable_bitmapscan = off
    ```

-   `parallel_data_fetch`: Specifies whether data fetch is performed in parallel (that is,
    using async connections to the databases). Improves performance of multi-way
    comparison. If any data connections aren't PostgreSQL, then this setting is
    automatically disabled. It's allowed only when
    `data_fetch_mode = prepared_statements` or
    `data_fetch_mode = server_side_cursors_with_hold`.
    Default: `on`.

-   `comparison_algorithm`: Affects how LiveCompare works through table rows to
    compare data. Using hashes is faster than full-row comparison. It can assume one
    of the following values:

    - `full_row`: Disables row comparison using hashes. Full comparison, in this
    case, is performed by comparing the row column by column.

    - `row_hash`: Enables row comparison using hashes and enables table
    splitting. Tables are split so each worker compares a maximum of
    `parallel_chunk_rows` per table. Data row is hashed in PostgreSQL, so the
    comparison is faster than `full_row`. However, if the hash for a specific row
    doesn't match, then for that specific row, LiveCompare falls back
    to the `full_row` algorithm (that is, compare row by row). If any data connection
    isn't PostgreSQL, then LiveCompare uses a row hash that's defined as the MD5
    hash of the concatenated column values of the row being considered, a
    *common hash* among the database technologies being compared.

    - `block_hash`: Works the same as `row_hash`, but instead of comparing row
    by row, LiveCompare builds a *block hash*, that is, a hash of the hashes of all
    rows in the data buffer that was just fetched (maximum of `buffer_size`
    rows). Conceptually it works like a two-level Merkle tree. If the block hash
    matches, then LiveCompare advances the whole block, which is why this
    comparison algorithm is faster than `row_hash`. If block hash doesn't
    match, then LiveCompare falls back to `row_hash` and performs the comparison row
    by row in the buffer to find the divergent rows. This is the default value.

-   `min_time_between_heart_beats`: Time in seconds to wait before logging a
    *heart beat* message to the log. Each worker tracks it separately per round
    part being compared. Default: 30 seconds.

-   `min_time_between_round_saves`: Time in seconds to wait before updating each
    round state when the comparison algorithm is in progress. A round save can
    happen only during a heart beat, so `min_time_between_round_saves` must be greater
    than or equal to `min_time_between_heart_beats`. When the round
    finishes, LiveCompare always updates the round state for that table.
    Default: 60 seconds.

    !!! Important
        If you cancel execution of LiveCompare by pressing **Ctrl-C**
        and start it again, then LiveCompare resumes the round for that table,
        starting from the point where the round state was saved.

-   `comparison_cost_limit`: If > 0, corresponds to a number of rows each worker
    processes before taking a nap of `comparison_cost_delay` seconds. Defaults
    to 0, meaning that each worker processes rows without taking a nap.

-   `comparison_cost_delay`: If `comparison_cost_limit > 0`, then this setting
    specifies how long each worker sleeps. Default: `0.0`.

-   `stop_after_time`: Time in seconds after which LiveCompare 
    stop as if you press **Ctrl-C**. You can resume the comparison session that was
    interrupted, if not finished yet, by passing the session
    ID as an argument in the command line. Default: `stop_after_time = 0`, which
    means that automatic interruption is disabled.

-   `consensus_mode`: Consensus algorithm used by LiveCompare to determine which
    data connections are divergent. Possible values are `simple_majority`,
    `quorum_based`, or `source_of_truth`. If `consensus_mode = source_of_truth`, then
    `difference_sources_of_truth` must be filled. Default: `simple_majority`.

-   `difference_required_quorum`: If `consensus_mode = quorum_based`, then this
    setting specifies the minimum quorum required to decide which connections are
    divergent. Must be a number between 0.0 and 1.0. 0.0 means no connection is
    required, and 1.0 means all connections are required. Both cases are extreme
    and we don't recommend using them. The default value is 0.5, and we recommend using a
    value close to that.

-   `difference_sources_of_truth`: Comma-separated list of connections names (or
    node names, if `logical_replication_mode = bdr` and `all_bdr_nodes = on`) to 
    consider as the source of truth. It's used only when `consensus_mode =
    source_of_truth`. For example: `difference_sources_of_truth = node1,node2`. In
    this example, either the sections `node1 Connection` and `node2 Connection`
    must be defined in the `.ini` file or `all_bdr_nodes = on` and only the `Initial
    Connection` is defined, while `node1` and `node2` must be valid PGD node
    names.

-   `difference_tie_breakers`: Comma-separated list of connection names (or node
    names, if `logical_replication_mode = bdr` and `all_bdr_nodes = on`) to
    be considered as tie breakers whenever the consensus algorithm finds a tie
    situation. For example: `difference_tie_breakers = node1,node2`. In this
    example, either the sections `node1 Connection` and `node2 Connections` must
    be defined in the `.ini` file or `all_bdr_nodes = on` and only the `Initial
    Connection` is defined, while `node1` and `node2` must be valid PGD node
    names. Default: Don't consider any connection as tie breaker.

-   `difference_statements`: Controls the kind of DML statements for
    LiveCompare to generate. The value of `difference_statements` can
    be one of:

    - `all` (default)
    - `inserts`
    - `updates`
    - `deletes`
    - `inserts_updates`
    - `inserts_deletes`
    - `updates_deletes`

-   `difference_allow_null_updates`: Determines whether commands like `UPDATE SET
    col = NULL` are allowed in the difference report. Default:
    `on`.

-   `difference_statement_order`: Controls order of DML statements that 
    LiveCompare generates. The value of `difference_statement_order`
    can be one of:

    - `delete_insert_update`
    - `delete_update_insert` (default)
    - `insert_update_delete`
    - `insert_delete_update`
    - `update_insert_delete`
    - `update_delete_insert`

-   `difference_fix_replication_origin`: When working with PGD databases, for
    difference, LiveCompare creates a specific replication origin if it doesn't
    exist yet. It then uses the replication origin to create an apply script with DML
    fixes. The setting `difference_fix_replication_origin` specifies the name of
    the replication origin used by LiveCompare. If you don't set any value
    for this setting, then LiveCompare sets
    `difference_fix_replication_origin = bdr_local_only_origin`. The
    replication origin that LiveCompare creates isn't dropped to allow verification
    after the comparison. However, if needed, you can manually drop the replication origin 
    later. Requires `logical_replication_mode = bdr`.

!!! Important
    PGD 3.6.18 introduced the new pre-created `bdr_local_only_origin` replication origin to use for applying local-only transactions. So if LiveCompare is connected to PGD 3.6.18, it doesn't create this replication origin, and we recommend you don't try to drop this replication origin.

-   `difference_fix_start_query`: Arbitrary query that's executed at the
    beginning of the apply script generated by LiveCompare. Additionally, if a PGD comparison
    is being performed and the `difference_fix_start_query` is empty, then
    LiveCompare also automatically does the following:

    - If the divergent connection is PGD 3.6.7, adds
    `SET LOCAL bdr.xact_replication = off;`
    - Adds commands that set up transaction to use the replication origin
    specified in `difference_fix_replication_origin`

-   `show_progress_bars`: Determines whether to show progress bars
    in the console output. Disabling this setting might be useful for batch
    executions. Default: `on`.

-   `output_schema`: In the output connection, the schema where the comparison
    report tables are created. Default: `livecompare`.

-   `hash_column_name`: Every data fetch contains a specific column that's
    the hash of all actual columns in the row. This setting specifies the name of
    this column. Default: `livecompare_hash`.

-   `rownumber_column_name`: Some fetches need to use the `row_number()` function
    value inside a query column. This setting specifies the name of this column.
    Default: `livecompare_rownumber`.

-   `fetch_row_origin`: When this setting is enabled, LiveCompare fetches the
    origin name for each divergent row, which might be useful for debugging
    purposes. To be enabled, requires `logical_replication_mode` set
    to `pglogical` or `bdr`. Default: `off`. 

-   `column_intersection`: When this setting is enabled, for a given table that's
    being compared, LiveCompare works only on the intersection of columns from
    the table on all connections, ignoring extra columns that might exist on any of
    the connections. When this setting is disabled, LiveCompare checks if
    columns are equivalent on the table on all connections and aborts the comparison
    of the table if there are any column mismatches. Default: `off`.

!!! Important
    If a table has PK, then the PK columns aren't allowed to be different, even if `column_intersection = on`.

-   `ignore_nullable`: For a specific table comparison, if LiveCompare is using a
    comparison key different from the primary key, then LiveCompare requires all
    columns to be `NOT NULL` if `ignore_nullable` is enabled (default). You can override 
    that behavior by setting `ignore_nullable = off`, which 
    allows LiveCompare to consider null-able columns in the comparison, which in some
    corner cases can produce false positives.

-   `check_uniqueness_enforcement`: If LiveCompare is using a user-defined
    comparison key or using all columns in the table as a comparison key, then
    LiveCompare checks for table uniqueness on the comparison key if setting
    `check_uniqueness_enforcement` is enabled (default).

-   `oracle_ignore_unsortable`: When enabled, tells LiveCompare to ignore columns
    with Oracle unsortable data types (BLOB, CLOB, NCLOB, BFILE) if column isn't
    part of the table PK. If enabling this setting, we recommend also enabling
    `column_intersection`.

-   `oracle_user_tables_only`: When enabled, tells LiveCompare to fetch table
    metadata only from the Oracle logged-in user. This approach is faster because it reads,
    for example, from `sys.user_tables` and `sys.user_tab_columns` instead of
    `sys.all_tables` and `sys.all_tab_columns`. Default: `off`.

-   `oracle_fetch_fk_metadata`: When enabled, tells LiveCompare to fetch foreign-key 
    metadata, which can be a slow operation. Overrides the value of the setting
    `fetch_fk_metadata` on the Oracle connection. Default: `off`.

-   `schema_qualified_table_names`: Table names are treated as schema qualified
    when this setting is enabled. Disabling it allows comparing tables without
    using schema-qualified table names. On Oracle x Postgres comparisons, it
    requires also enabling `oracle_user_tables_only`. On Postgres x Postgres,
    it allows for comparisons of tables that are under different schemas, even in
    the same database. Also, when `schema_qualified_table_names` is enabled,
    `Table Filter -> tables`, `Row Filter`, and `Column Filter` allow table name
    without the schema name. Default: `on`.

-   `force_collate`: When set to a value other than `off` and to a valid collation
    name, forces the specified collation name in `ORDER BY` operations in all
    Postgres databases being compared. Useful when comparing Postgres databases with
    different collation or when comparing Oracle and Postgres databases. (In this
    case, set `force_collate = C`.) Assumes value `C` if comparing
    mixed technologies (like Oracle versus PostgreSQL) and no collation is specified.
    Default: `off`.

-   `work_directory`: Path to the `LiveCompare` working directory. The session
    folder containing output files is created in this directory. Default:
    `.` (current directory).

-   `abort_on_setup_error`: When enabled, if LiveCompare encounters any error when
    trying to set up a table comparison round, the whole comparison session is
    aborted. Default: `off`.

!!! Important
    Setting `abort_on_setup_error` is considered only during `compare` mode. In `recheck` mode, LiveCompare always aborts at the first error in setup.

-   `custom_dollar_quoting_delimiter`: When LiveCompare finds differences, it
    outputs the DML using dollar quoting on strings. The default behavior is to create
    a random string to compose it. If you want by any means to use a custom one, you
    can set this parameter as the delimiter to use. You need to set only the
    constant, not the `$` symbols around the constant. Default: `off`, which
    means LiveCompare uses an `md5` hash of the word `LiveCompare`.

-   `session_replication_role_replica`: When enabled, LiveCompare uses the
    `session_replication_role` PostgreSQL setting  as `replica` in the output apply
    scripts. That's useful if you want to prevent firing triggers and rules while
    applying DML in the nodes with divergences. Enabling it requires a PostgreSQL
    superuser. Otherwise, it has no effect. Default: `off`.

-   `split_updates`: When enabled, LiveCompare splits `UPDATE` divergences.
    That is, instead of generating an `UPDATE` DML, it generates corresponding
    `DELETE` and `INSERT` in the apply script. Default: `off`.

-   `float_point_round`: An integer to specify decimal digits that LiveCompare
    rounds when comparing float-point values coming from the database. Default:
    `-1`, which disables float-point rounding.

## Initial Connection

The initial connection is used only when `logical_replication_mode` is set to
`pglogical` or `bdr`. If you set data connections to use only the `node_name`
setting, it's used when the program starts to fetch DSN
from node names.

-   `technology`: RDBMS technology. Currently the only possible value is
    `postgresql`.
-   `dsn`: PostgreSQL connection string. If `dsn` is set, then `host`, `port`,
    `dbname`, and `user` are ignored. The `dsn` setting can also have all other
    [parameter key words allowed by libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS).
-   `host`: Server address. Leave empty to use the Unix socket connection.
-   `port`: Port. Default: `5432`.
-   `dbname`: Database name. Default: `postgres`.
-   `user`: Database user. Default: `postgres`.
-   `application_name`. Application name. Can be used even if you set `dsn`
    instead of all other connection information. Default: `livecompare_initial`.

## Output Connection

The output connection specifies where LiveCompare creates the comparison
report tables.

-   `technology`: RDBMS technology. Currently the only possible value is
    `postgresql`.
-   `dsn`: PostgreSQL connection string. If `dsn` is set, then `host`, `port`,
    `dbname`, and `user` are ignored. The `dsn` setting can also have all other
    [parameter key words allowed by libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS).
-   `host`: Server address. Leave empty to use the Unix socket connection.
-   `port`: Port. Default: `5432`.
-   `dbname`: Database name. Default: `postgres`.
-   `user`: Database user. Default: `postgres`.
-   `application_name`. Application name. Can be used even if you set `dsn`
    instead of all other connection information. Default: `livecompare_output`.

## Data Connection

A data connection is a connection section similar to `Initial Connection`
and `Output Connection`, but LiveCompare effectively fetches and compares
data on the data connections.

Similar to the `Initial Connection` and `Output Connection`, a data
connection is defined in a named section. The section name is of the
form `<Name> Connection`, with `<Name>` being any single-word string starting with an
alphabetic character. In this case, whatever you use as `Name` is called
the *connection ID* of the data connection. Each data
connection must also have a unique connection ID in the list of data connections.

If `logical_replication_mode = bdr` and `all_bdr_nodes = on`, then you don't need
to specify any data connection. LiveCompare builds the
data connection list by fetching PGD metadata from the `Initial Connection`.

-   `technology`: RDBMS technology. Currently possible values are `postgresql` or
    `oracle`.
-   `node_name`: Name of the node in the cluster. Requires
    `logical_replication_mode` set to `pglogical` or `bdr` and also requires that
    the `Initial Connection` is filled. If `node_name` is set, then `dsn`, `host`,
    `port`, `dbname`, and `user` settings are all ignored.
-   `dsn`: PostgreSQL connection string. If `dsn` is set, then `host`, `port`,
    `dbname`, and `user` are ignored. The `dsn` setting can also have all other
    [parameter key words allowed by libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS).
-   `host`: Server address. Leave empty to use the Unix socket connection.
-   `port`: Port. Default: `5432`.
-   `dbname`: Database name. Default: `postgres`.
-   `service`: Service name, used in Oracle connections. Default: `XE`.
-   `user`: Database user. Default: `postgres`.
-   `password`: Plain text password. We don't recommend using this. However, it might be required
    in some legacy connections.
-   `application_name`. Application name. Can be used even if you set `dsn`
    or `node_name` instead of all other connection information. Default:
    `livecompare_<Connection ID>`.
-   `start_query`: Arbitrary query that's executed each time a connection to a
    database is open.
-   `fetch_fk_metadata`: Specifies whether LiveCompare gathers metadata about foreign keys
    on the connection. Default: `on`.

## Table Filter

If omitted or left empty, this section from the `.ini` file means that
LiveCompare executes against all tables in the first database.

If you want LiveCompare to execute against a specific set of tables, there
are different ways to specify this:

-   `publications`: You can filter specific publications, and LiveCompare uses
    only the tables associated with those publications. You can use the variable
    `publication_name` to build the conditional expression, for example:

    ```ini
    publications = publication_name = 'livepub'
    ```

    Requires `logical_replication_mode = native`.

-   `replication_sets`: When using pglogical or PGD, you can filter specific
    replication sets, and LiveCompare works only on the tables associated with
    those replication sets. You can use the variable `set_name` to build the
    conditional expression, for example:

    ```ini
    replication_sets = set_name in ('default', 'bdrgroup')
    ```

    Requires `logical_replication_mode = pglogical` or
    `logical_replication_mode = bdr`.

-   `schemas`: You can filter specific schemas, and LiveCompare works only on
    the tables that belong to those schemas. You can use the variable `schema_name`
    to build the conditional expression, for example:

    ```ini
    schemas = schema_name != 'badschema'
    ```

-   `tables`: The variable `table_name` can help you build a conditional
    expression to filter only the tables you want LiveCompare to work on, for
    example:

    ```ini
    tables = table_name not like '%%account'
    ```

    In any conditional expression, escape the `%` character as `%%`.

The table name must be schema-qualified, unless `schema_qualified_table_names`
is disabled. For example, you can filter only a specific list of
tables:

```
tables = table_name in ('myschema1.mytable1', 'myschema2.mytable2')
```

If you disable the general setting `schema_qualified_table_names`, then you
must also set an appropriate `search_path` for Postgres in the connection
`start_query` setting, for example:

```
[General Setting]
...
schema_qualified_table_names = off

[My Connection]
...
start_query = SET search_path TO myschema1, myschema2

[Table Filter]
tables = table_name in ('mytable1', 'mytable2')
```

!!! Important
    If two or more schemas that were set on `search_path` contain a table with the same name, just the first one found is considered in the comparison.

The `Table Filter` section can have a mix of `publications`, `replication_sets`,
`schemas`, and `tables` filters. LiveCompare considers the set of tables
that are in the intersection of all filters you specified. For example:

```ini
[Table Filter]
publications = publication_name = 'livepub'
replication_sets = set_name in ('default', 'bdrgroup')
schemas = schema_name != 'badschema'
tables = table_name not like '%%account'
```

The table filter is applied in the first database to
build the table list. If a table exists in the first database and is being
considered in the filter, but it doesn't exist in any other database, then you
something like this is added to the logs, and the comparison for that specific
table is skipped:

```text
2019-06-17 11:52:41,403 - ERROR - live_table.py - 55 - GetMetaData - P1: livecompare_second_1: Table public.test does not exist
2019-06-17 11:52:41,410 - ERROR - live_round.py - 201 - Initialize - P1: Table public.test does not exist on second connection. Aborting comparison
```

Similarly, if a table exists in any other database but doesn't exist in the
first database, then it isn't considered in the comparison, even if you
didn't apply any table filter.

A comparison for a specific table is also skipped if the table column names
aren't exactly the same (unless `column_intersection` is enabled), and in the
same order. An appropriate message is added to the log file as well.

Currently LiveCompare doesn't check if data types or constraints are the same
on both tables.

!!! Important
    `conflicts` mode doesn't make use of the table filter.

## Row Filter

In this section, you can apply a row-level filter to any table, so LiveCompare
works only on the rows that satisfy the row filter.

You can write a list of tables under this section, one table per line. All
table names must be schema qualified unless `schema_qualified_table_names` is
disabled. For example:

```ini
[Row Filter]
public.table1 = id = 10
public.table2 = logdate >= '2000-01-01'
```

In this case, for the table `public.table1`, LiveCompare works only in the
rows that satisfy the clause `id = 10`. For the table `public.table2`,
only rows that satisfy `logdate >= '2000-01-01` are considered in the
comparison.

If you disable the general setting `schema_qualified_table_names`, then you
must also set an appropriate `search_path` for Postgres in the connection
`start_query` setting, for example:

```
[General Setting]
...
schema_qualified_table_names = off

[My Connection]
...
start_query = SET search_path TO public

[Row Filter]
table1 = id = 10
table2 = logdate >= '2000-01-01'
```

Any kind of SQL condition (same as you put in the `WHERE` clause) is
accepted in the same line as the table row filter. For example, if you have a
large table and want to compare only a specific number of IDs, you can
create a temporary table with all the IDs. Then you can use an `IN` clause to
emulate a `JOIN`, like this:  

```
[Row Filter]
public.large_table = id IN (SELECT id2 FROM temp_table)
```

If a row filter is written incorrectly, then LiveCompare tries to apply the
filter but fails. So the comparison for this specific table is skipped,
and an exception is written to the log file.

If a table is listed in the `Row Filter` section but somehow got filtered out
by the `Table Filter`, then the row filter for this table is silently
ignored.

!!! Important
    `conflicts` mode doesn't make use of the row filter.

### Using current timestamp in Row Filter

The `Row Filter` is applied differently depending on the `data_fetch_mode`:

-   On Postgres, setting `data_fetch_mode` to `server_side_cursors_with_hold` or
    `server_side_cursors_without_hold` causes the `Row Filter` to be applied
    only at the beginning of the table comparison, when the query is executed. This
    means that using a server-side cursor to fetch data ensures the data is seen as
    a snapshot of how it was beginning of the comparison.
-   On Postgres, setting `data_fetch_mode` to `prepared_statements` (the default)
    includes the `Row Filter` in the prepared query, which is then
    executed at every data buffer that's fetched. This means that, if the query
    uses `now()`, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, or `SYSDATE` (on EDB Postgres Advanced Server) on the `Row Filter`,
    then when the prepared statement executes, Postgres reevaluates the
    current timestamp.

So, suppose you're using `now()`, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, or `SYSDATE` on the `Row Filter`,
for example:

```
[Row Filter]
public.table3 = logdate < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
```

In this case, you must also use a server-side cursor to ensure the current
timestamp is evaluated only at the beginning of the queries. In other words,
`data_fetch_mode` must be set to a value different from
`prepared_statements`.

On Oracle, the `data_fetch_mode` setting is ignored, and
the query is executed at the beginning. Then data is fetched by way of the client-side
cursor. This approach ensures data is seen as a snapshot of how it was at the beginning
of the comparison. This is a client-side cursor, but the behavior is similar to
using a server-side cursor in Postgres.

## Column Filter

In this section, you can apply a column-level filter to any table, so LiveCompare
works only on the columns that aren't part of the column filter.

You can write a list of tables under this section, one table per line. All
table names must be schema qualified unless `schema_qualified_table_names` is
disabled. For example, suppose that both `public.table1` and `public.table2` have
the columns `column1`, `column2`, `column3`, `column4`, and `column5`:

```ini
[Column Filter]
public.table1 = column1, column3
public.table2 = column1, column5
```

In this case, for the table `public.table1`, LiveCompare works only in the
columns `column2`, `column4`, and `column5`, filtering out `column1` and `column3`.
For the table `public.table2`, only the columns `column2`, `column3`, and
`column4` are considered in the comparison, filtering out `column1` and `column5`.

If you disable the general setting `schema_qualified_table_names`, then you
must also set an appropriate `search_path` for Postgres in the connection
`start_query` setting, for example:

```
[General Setting]
...
schema_qualified_table_names = off

[My Connection]
...
start_query = SET search_path TO public

[Column Filter]
table1 = column1, column3
table2 = column1, column5
```

If absent column names are given in the column filter, that is, the column doesn't
exist in the given table, then LiveCompare logs a message about the missing columns
and ignores them. It uses just the valid ones, if any.

If a table is listed in the `Column Filter` section but somehow got filtered
out by the `Table Filter`, then the column filter for this table is
silently ignored.

!!! Important
    If a column specified in a `Column Filter` is part of the table PK, then it isn't ignored in the comparison. LiveCompare logs that and ignores the filter of such a column.

!!! Important
    `conflicts` mode doesn't make use of the column filter.

## Comparison Key

!!! Tip "New feature"
   LiveCompare comparison key support is available in LiveCompare version 2.0 and later.
!!!

Similar to the `Column Filter`, in this section you can also specify a list
of columns per table. These columns are considered as a comparison key for
the specific table, even if the table has a primary key or `UNIQUE` constraint.

For example:

```ini
[Comparison Key]
public.table1 = col_a, col_b
public.table2 = c1, c2
```

In this example, for table `public.table1`, the comparison key is
columns `col_a` and `col_b`. For table `public.table2`, columns `c1` and `c2` are
considered as a comparison key.

The same behavior about missing columns or filtered out or missing tables that
are explained in [Column Filter](#column-filter), also apply to the comparison
key. Similarly, the `Comparison Key` section is ignored in `conflicts` mode.

## Conflicts Filter

In this section, you can specify a filter to use in `--conflicts` mode while
fetching conflicts from PGD nodes. You can build any SQL conditional expression
and use these fields in the expression:

-   `origin_node`: The upstream node of the subscription.
-   `target_node`: The downstream node of the subscription.
-   `local_time`: The timestamp when the conflict occurred in the node.
-   `conflict_type`: The type of conflict.
-   `conflict_resolution`: The resolution that was applied.
-   `nspname`: Schema name of the involved relation.
-   `relname`: Relation name of the involved relation.

You must use the `conflicts` attribute under the section. For example:

```
[Conflicts Filter]
conflicts = conflict_type = 'update_missing' AND nspname = 'my_schema'
```

If you add this piece of configuration to your `.ini` file, LiveCompare fetches
only conflicts that are of type `update_missing` and related to tables under
the schema `my_schema` while querying for conflicts in each of the PGD nodes.

!!! Important
    This section is exclusively for `--conflicts` mode.
