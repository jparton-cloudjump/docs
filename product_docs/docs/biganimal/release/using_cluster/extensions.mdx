BigAnimal supports many Postgres extensions. See [Postgres extensions available by deployment](/pg_extensions/) for the complete list.

You need superuser privileges to install most extensions on BigAnimal. The table in [Postgres extensions available by deployment](/pg_extensions/) indicates whether an extension requires superuser privileges. If you are using your own cloud account, you can grant superuser privileges to edb_admin so that you can install these extensions on your cluster (see [superuser](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/01_postgres_access/#superuser)). If you are using BigAnimal's account, you can't install the extensions that require superuser access. 

## Installing extensions

Use the [`CREATE EXTENSION`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html) command to install extensions, except for the EDB Postgres Tuner (pg_tuner) extension. You enable edb_pg_tuner on the **DB Configuration** tab of the Create or Edit Cluster page of the BigAnimal portal.


### Example: Installing multiple extensions

One way of installing multiple extensions simultaneously is to:

1. Create a text file containing the `CREATE EXTENSION` command for each of the extensions you want to install. In this example, the file is named `create_extensions.sql`.

   ```text
   CREATE EXTENSION <extension_name_1> SCHEMA <schema_name>;
   CREATE EXTENSION <extension_name_2> SCHEMA <schema_name>;
   CREATE EXTENSION <extension_name_3> SCHEMA <schema_name>;
   CREATE EXTENSION <extension_name_4> SCHEMA <schema_name>;
   ```

1. Use your Postgres client of choice to load the extensions. For example, using psql:

   ```shell
   psql <biganimal_connection_string> -f create_extensions.sql
   ```
   For more information about connecting to your cluster using a client, see [Connecting to your cluster](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/02_connecting_your_cluster/).

## Working with extensions

Use the [DROP EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-dropextension.html) command to remove extensions. 

Use the [pg_available_extensions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-available-extensions.html) view to see a list of all PostreSQL extensions.

The [catalog_pg_extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-extension.html) catalog stores information about the installed extensions.
