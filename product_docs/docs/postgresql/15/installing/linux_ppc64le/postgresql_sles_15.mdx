title: Installing PostgreSQL on SLES 15 ppc64le
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the repository
  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Address other prerequisites

  ```shell
  # Activate the required SUSE module
  sudo SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.3/ppc64le

  # Refresh the metadata
  sudo zypper refresh
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo zypper -n install postgresql<xx>-server postgresql<xx>-contrib
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of PostgreSQL you are installing. For example, if you are installing version 15, the package name would be `postgresql15-server postgresql15-contrib`.
