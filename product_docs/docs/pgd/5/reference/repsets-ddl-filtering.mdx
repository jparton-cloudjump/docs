### `bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter`

This function adds a DDL filter to a replication set.

Any DDL that matches the given filter is replicated to any node that's
subscribed to that set. This also affects replication of PGD admin functions.

This doesn't prevent execution of DDL on any node. It only
alters whether DDL is replicated to other nodes. Suppose two nodes have
a replication filter between them that excludes all index commands. Index commands can still 
be executed freely by directly connecting to
each node and executing the desired DDL on that node.

The DDL filter can specify a `command_tag` and `role_name` to allow
replication of only some DDL statements. The `command_tag` is the same as those
used by [EVENT TRIGGERs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/event-trigger-matrix.html)
for regular PostgreSQL commands. A typical example might be to create a
filter that prevents additional index commands on a logical standby from
being replicated to all other nodes.

You can filter the PGD admin functions used by using a tagname matching the
qualified function name. For example, `bdr.replication_set_add_table` is the
command tag for the function of the same name. In this case, this tag allows all PGD
functions to be filtered using `bdr.*`.

The `role_name` is used for matching against the current role that is executing
the command. Both `command_tag` and `role_name` are evaluated as regular
expressions, which are case sensitive.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter(set_name name,
                                   ddl_filter_name text,
                                   command_tag text,
                                   role_name text DEFAULT NULL,
                                   base_relation_name text DEFAULT NULL,
                                   query_match text DEFAULT NULL,
                                   exclusive boolean DEFAULT FALSE)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` &mdash; name of the replication set; if NULL then the PGD
     group default replication set is used
-   `ddl_filter_name` &mdash; name of the DDL filter; this must be unique across the
    whole PGD group
-   `command_tag` &mdash; regular expression for matching command tags; NULL means
    match everything
-   `role_name` &mdash; regular expression for matching role name; NULL means
    match all roles
-   `base_relation_name` &mdash; reserved for future use, must be NULL
-   `query_match` &mdash; regular expression for matching the query; NULL means
    match all queries
-   `exclusive` &mdash; if true, other matched filters are not taken into
    consideration (that is, only the exclusive filter is applied), when multiple
    exclusive filters match, we throw an error. This is useful for routing
    specific commands to specific replication set, while keeping the default
    replication through the main replication set.

#### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
that the replication is affected by the [ddl filters](../repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration. This also means that replication of changes to ddl
filter configuration is affected by the existing ddl filter configuration.

The function takes a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction. The changes are visible to the current
transaction.

To view the defined replication filters, use the view `bdr.ddl_replication`.

#### Examples

To include only PGD admin functions, define a filter like this:

```sql
SELECT bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter('mygroup', 'mygroup_admin', $$bdr\..*$$);
```

To exclude everything apart from index DDL:

```sql
SELECT bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter('mygroup', 'index_filter',
				'^(?!(CREATE INDEX|DROP INDEX|ALTER INDEX)).*');
```

To include all operations on tables and indexes but exclude all others, add
two filters: one for tables, one for indexes. This shows that
multiple filters provide the union of all allowed DDL commands:

```sql
SELECT bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter('bdrgroup','index_filter', '^((?!INDEX).)*$');
SELECT bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter('bdrgroup','table_filter', '^((?!TABLE).)*$');
```

### `bdr.replication_set_remove_ddl_filter`

This function removes the DDL filter from a replication set.

Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration,
including DDL filtering settings themselves.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.replication_set_remove_ddl_filter(set_name name,
                                      ddl_filter_name text)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` &mdash; Name of the replication set. If NULL then the PGD
     group default replication set is used.
-   `ddl_filter_name` &mdash; Name of the DDL filter to remove.

#### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This
means that the replication is affected by the
[ddl filters](../repsets#ddl-replication-filtering) configuration. 
This also means that replication of changes to the DDL filter configuration is
affected by the existing DDL filter configuration.

The function takes a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction. The changes are visible to the current
transaction.
