EDB provides a graphical interactive installer for Windows. You can access it two ways:

- Download the graphical installer from the [Downloads page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres), and invoke the installer directly. See [Installing directly](#installing-directly). WHERE DO YOU ACCESS LANGUAGE PACK INSTALLER? CAN YOU LINK DIRECTLY TO LANGUAGE PACK OR IS IT PART OF EPAS?

- Use Stack Builder (with PostgreSQL) or StackBuilder Plus (with EDB Postgres Advanced Server) to download the EDB installer package and invoke the graphical installer.  See [Using Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus](#using-stack-builder-or-stackbuilder-plus).


## Installing directly

After downloading the graphical installer, to start the installation wizard, assume sufficient privileges (superuser or administrator) and double-click the installer icon. If prompted, provide a password.

In some versions of Windows, to invoke the installer with administrator privileges, you need to right-click the installer icon and select **Run as Administrator** from the context menu.

Proceed to [Using the graphical installer](#using-the-graphical-installer).


## Using Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus

If you're using PostgreSQL, you can invoke the graphical installer with Stack Builder. See [Using Stack Builder](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/supported-open-source/postgresql/installer/03_using_stackbuilder/). 

If you're using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you can invoke the graphical installer with StackBuilder Plus. See [Using StackBuilder Plus](/epas/latest/epas_inst_windows/installing_advanced_server_with_the_interactive_installer/using_stackbuilder_plus/). 

1. In Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus, follow the prompts until you get to the module selection page.

   On the Welcome page, select the target server installation from the list of available servers. If your network requires you to use a proxy server to access the internet, select **Proxy servers** and specify a server. Select **Next**.

1. Expand the **Add-ons, tools, and utilities** node.

1. Select the version of **EDB Language Pack** you want to install.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Browse to a directory where you want to install the language pack, or leave the directory set to the default location. Select **Next**.

1. When the installer states that all installation files have been downloaded, select **Next**.

1. Proceed to [Using the graphical installer](#using-the-graphical-installer).

## Using the graphical installer 

1. Select the installation language and select **OK**.

1. On the Setup Language Pack page, select **Next**.

   The Ready to Install window displays the Language Pack installation directory. IS THAT THE NAME OF THE PAGE?

   `C:/edb/languagepack/v2` DOES THIS ACTUALLY DISPLAY?

   You cannot modify the installation directory. 

1. On the Ready to Install page, select **Next**.

   An information box shows the installation progress of the selected components. 

1. When the installation is complete, select **Finish**.
