## Installing Language Pack with Stack Builder

You can use Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus to download and invoke the Language Pack graphical installer. StackBuilder Plus is distributed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server and Stack Builder is distributed with PostgreSQL.

The following section walks you through installing Language Pack with Stack Builder.

The Stack Builder utility provides a graphical interface that simplifies the process of downloading and installing modules that complement your PostgreSQL installation.

Stack Builder requires Internet access; if your installation of PostgreSQL resides behind a firewall (with restricted Internet access), Stack Builder can download program installers through a proxy server. The module provider deter-mines if the module can be accessed through an HTTP proxy or an FTP proxy; currently, all updates are transferred via an HTTP proxy and the FTP proxy information is not used.

You can invoke Stack Builder at any time after the installation has completed by selecting the `Application Stack Builder` menu option from the `PostgreSQL 14` menu.

Select your server from the drop-down menu on the Stack Builder Welcome window and click `Next` to continue.
