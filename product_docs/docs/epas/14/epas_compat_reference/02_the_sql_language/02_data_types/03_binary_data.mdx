A binary string is a sequence of octets (or bytes). Binary strings are distinguished from characters strings by two characteristics: 

-  Binary strings specifically allow storing octets of value zero and other "non-printable" octets (defined as octets outside the range 32 to 126). 
-  Operations on binary strings process the actual bytes, whereas the encoding and processing of character strings depends on locale settings.

## `BINARY`

Description &mdash; Fixed-length binary string, with a length between 1 and 8300.  

Storage size &mdash; The length of the binary string 

## `BLOB` 

Description &mdash; Variable-length binary string, with a maximum size of 1 GB 

Storage size &mdash; The actual binary string plus 1 byte if the binary string is less than 127 bytes, or 4 bytes if the binary string is 127 bytes or greater

## `VARBINARY`

Description - Variable-length binary string, with a length between 1 and 8300

Storage Size - The length of the binary string
