EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports Enumerated (enum) types.

| Name      | Native | Alias | Description                                   |
| --------- | ------ | ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `ENUM`    | âœ…     |       | Static, ordered set of values, 4 bytes storage, max length is limited by NAMEDATALEN setting into PostgreSQL. |

This example shows how to create `ENUM` types and use it:

```sql
CREATE TYPE city AS ENUM('Pune','Mumbai','Chennai');

CREATE TABLE shops(name text, location city);

INSERT INTO shops VALUES('Puma',`Mumbai` );

SELECT * FROM shops;
__OUTPUT__
  name  |  location
--------+-----------
  Puma  | Mumbai
```

`ENUM` types are case sensitive, and whitespace in Enum types is also significant.

The ENUM types and its labels are stored in `pg_enum` system catalog.
