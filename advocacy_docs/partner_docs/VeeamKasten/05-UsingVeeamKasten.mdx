When you have configured your Kubernetes environment per the Configuring section you will then be able to start taking backups and completing restores.

## Create a Backup Policy with the EDB hooks

In the `Configuring` section, you installed the EDB Blueprint with the edb-hooks.yaml file.  You will now be able to create a backup policy with those hooks.

1. Create a policy for the EDB namespace, you will need to set up a location profile for the export and kanister actions.

Add the hooks example:
    ![Kasten Backup Policy with EDB Hooks](Images/KastenBackupPolicywithHooks.png)

## Launch a Backup

1. Using Veeam Kasten K10 launch a backup that creates two restore points, a local and a remote.

2. Delete the namespace `EDB`.

```bash
kubectl delete ns edb
```

## Restore Database

1. Go to your remote restore point.

2. On the remote restore point select `restore`.

3. After you have restored all of your data should be present.
