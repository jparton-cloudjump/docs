When you have configured your Kubernetes environment per the `Configuring` section you will then be able to start taking backups and completing restores.

## Launch a Backup

1. Using Veeam Kasten K10 launch a backup that creates two restore points, a local and a remote.

!!! Note
    The Veeam backup process is explained below:
    1. EDB elects a replica for the backup.
    . Kasten will discover the replica.
    3. Kasten calls the EDB pre-backup command on the discovered replica.
    4. The replica becomes ready for the backup.
    5. Kasten takes the backup.
    6. Kasten calls the EDB post backup command on the replica.
    7. The replica leaves the backup mode.
    8. The backup is then over and is consistent for a restore.

2. Delete the namespace `EDB`.

```bash
kubectl delete ns edb
```

## Restore Database

1. Go to your remote restore point.

2. On the remote restore point select `restore`.

3. After you have restored all of your data should be present.
