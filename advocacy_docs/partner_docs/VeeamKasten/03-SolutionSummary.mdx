Veeam Kasten is a data management platform built for Kubernetes that can provide enterprise operations teams with an easy-to-use and secure system for backup and restore of Kubernetes applications.  Veeam Kasten can be used in conjunction with EDB Postgres for Kubernetes and the EDB external backup adapter to successfully backup and restore data with Veeam Kasten.

The EDB Postgres for Kubernetes [external backup adapter](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/addons/#external-backup-adapter) allows for a third party tool such as Veeam Kasten to discover an API that is needed in order to create a successful backup.
