Implementing EDB software on HPE requires the following components:
!!! Note
    The EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server and PostgreSQL Server products will be referred to as Postgres Distribution.  The specific Distribution type will be dependant upon customer need or preference.

- Postgres Distribution
- HPE system components configured per your requirements

Sample deployment:

## Prerequisites

- HPE servers set up per your requirements


## SSH Into Server and Deploy Postgres Distribution


1. SSH into your server per your chosen method, for example if on a Windows system accessing a RHEL Server, you would want to use a utility like PuTTy to SSH into your server to access it.

2. Login as the `Root` user via credentials you established with HPE during your server setup.

3. Install your preferred Postgres Distribution. For example, for EDB Postgres Advanced Server refer to the [EDB Postgres Advanced Server documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/). 

4. Install the other EDB tools, such as [EDB Failover Manager (EFM)](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/efm/latest/), [Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM)](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pem/latest/), or [Barman](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/supported-open-source/barman/), as needed for your configuration in the appropriate servers. Refer to the [EDB documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs) for any other software needs.
