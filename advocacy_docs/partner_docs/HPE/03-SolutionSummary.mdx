EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server, PostgreSQL, Failover Manager, Postgres Enterprise Manager, and Barman can each be deployed on HPE hardware that is customizable per customer needs.   Furthermore, using the HPE GreenLake Database model with EDB Postgres allows for a simpler end-to-end solution for the entire lifecycle of the database environment.

HPE GreenLake Database works to remove some of the complexities of getting a database up and running which then allows you to deploy all of your EDB products quickly and securely.  HPE does this by taking on some of the in depth pieces like designing, implementing and operating a database so customers do not have to put as much focus into these areas.  HPE provides customers with complete, scalable solutions for all of their server needs in order to run their databases efficiently.        

The following diagram shows what EDB products were tested on HPE Servers:
