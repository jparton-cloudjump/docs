Implementing EDB software on Nutanix AHV requires the following components:
!!! Note
    The EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server and PostgreSQL Server products will be referred to as Postgres Distribution.  The specific Distribution type will be dependant upon customer need or preference.

- Postgres Distribution
- Nutanix software

Sample deployment: 



## Prerequisites

- A running Nutanix cluster with AHV.
- Access to the Prism web console.



   For more details, read the [Prism Central Guide](https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Prism-Central-Guide-Prism-v5_19:Prism-Central-Guide-Prism-v5_19).

## Deploying VMs Using AHV

To create a Virtual Machine (VM) via AHV:


1. On Prism Central, select **Create VM**. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4wBewXfDs8) from Nutanix for more information.



2. Enter the  appropriate values for your configuration. For example, these are the specifications for a test environment:
    ```
    vCPU(s): 2
    Memory: 4 GiB
    Storage: DISK 50 GiB
    Guest OS: CentOS7
   ```


!!! Note
    Mount the CD-ROM with CentOS7 ISO available via the Image Service.



3. Select **Save**.

2. Install your preferred Postgres Distribution. For example, for EDB Postgres Advanced Server refer to the [EDB Postgres Advanced Server documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/). 

3. Install the other EDB tools, such as [EDB Failover Manager (EFM)](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/efm/latest/), [Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM)](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pem/latest/), or [Barman](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/supported-open-source/barman/), as needed for your configuration in the appropriate VMs. Refer to the [EDB documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs).
