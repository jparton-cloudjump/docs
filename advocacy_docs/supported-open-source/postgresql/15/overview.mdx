# FROM EDB Installers topic

EDB's PostgreSQL installers simplify the process of installing PostgreSQL on your computer. The installers provide:

- A distribution-independent PostgreSQL installation.
- The popular open-source PostgreSQL administration tool pgAdmin.
- The Stack Builder package manager for Windows and MacOS. Use this utility to download and install drivers, tools, and applications to complement your PostgreSQL installation.

Rather than use the EDB installers, you can obtain a prebuilt installation package and instructions for most common computing platforms directly from the [PostgreSQL downloads page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

## EDB Language Pack installer

You can use the EDB Language Pack installer with PostgreSQL installations and EDB Postgres Advanced Server installations. For details, see the [Language Pack documentation](/epas/latest/language_pack/).




ADD THESE SENTENCES TO WINDOWS AND MAC TOPICS: 
- To download PostgreSQL installers for Windows and Mac, see the [EDB downloads page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgresql). Add this sentence to WIndows and Mac topics

- When the PostgreSQL installation finishes, you can optionally invoke the Stack Builder package manager. Stack Builder provides a graphical interface for downloading and installing applications, drivers, utilities, and their dependencies. See [Using Stack Builder](../03_using_stackbuilder) for more information.

!!! Note
    If you're using the graphical installation wizard to perform a system upgrade, the installer preserves the configuration options specified during the previous installation. -- Do we need an upgrade topic???



DO WE NEED THIS: EDB also makes PostgreSQL Early Experience distributions available. For details, see [PostgreSQL Early Experience](https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgresql-early-experience).
