EDB's PostgreSQL installers simplify the process of installing PostgreSQL on your computer. The installers provide:

- A distribution-independent PostgreSQL installation.
- The popular open-source PostgreSQL administration tool pgAdmin.
- The Stack Builder package manager for Windows and MacOS. Use this utility to download and install drivers, tools, and applications to complement your PostgreSQL installation.

Rather than use the EDB installers, you can also obtain a prebuilt installation package and instructions for most common computing platforms directly from the [PostgreSQL downloads page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

EDB also makes PostgreSQL Early Experience distributions available. For details, see [PostgreSQL Early Experience](https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgresql-early-experience).

## EDB Language Pack installer

You can use the EDB Language Pack installer with PostgreSQL installations and EDB Postgres Advanced Server installations. For details, see the [Language Pack documentation](/epas/latest/language_pack/).
