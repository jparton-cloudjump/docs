EDB Wait States is a tool for analyzing performance and tuning. The EDB Wait States contrib module contains two main components: the EDB Wait States Background Worker (EWSBW) and the EDB Wait States interface. 

When EWSBW is registered as one of the shared preload libraries, it probes each of the running sessions at regular intervals. For every session, it collects information such as:

-  The database to which it's connected.
-  The logged-in user of the session.
-  The query running in that session.
-  The wait events on which it's waiting.

This information is saved in a set of files in a user-configurable path and directory folder given by the `edb_wait_states.directory` parameter to add to the `postgresql.conf` file. The path must be a full, absolute path, not a relative path.
