navTitle: Installing
---

## On Linux 

To install EWSBW on a Linux system:

1.  Install EDB wait states with the `edb-asxx-server-edb_wait_states` RPM package, where `xx` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number.

1. To launch the worker, register it in the `postgresql.conf` file using the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter. For example:

  ```ini
  shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/edb_wait_states'
  ```

1.  Restart the database server. After a successful restart, the background worker begins collecting data.

1. To review the data, create the following extension:

  ```sql
  CREATE EXTENSION edb_wait_states;
  ```

1. To terminate the EDB wait states worker, remove `$libdir/edb_wait_states` from the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter, and restart the database server.

## On Windows

To install EWSBW on a Windows system:

1.  To install the EDB wait states module with the `EDB Modules` installer, invoke the StackBuilder Plus utility. Follow the onscreen instructions to finish installing the `EDB Modules`.

1. To register the worker, modify the `postgresql.conf` file to include the wait states library in the `shared_preload_libraries` configuration parameter. The parameter value must include:

  ```ini
  shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/edb_wait_states.dll'
  ```

  The EDB wait states installation places the `edb_wait_states.dll` library file in the following path:

  ```text
  C:\Program Files\edb\as14\lib\
  ```

1. Restart the database server to make the changes take effect. After a successful restart, the background worker starts and begins collecting the data.

1. To view the data, create the following extension:

   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION edb_wait_states;
   ```

The installer places the `edb_wait_states.control` file in the following path:

```text
C:\Program Files\edb\as14\share\extension
```

## Terminating

To terminate the EDB wait states worker:

1.  Use the `DROP EXTENSION` command to drop the `edb_wait_states` extension. 
1.  Modify the `postgresql.conf` file, removing `$libdir/edb_wait_states.dll` from the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter. 
1.  To apply your changes, restart the database server.
